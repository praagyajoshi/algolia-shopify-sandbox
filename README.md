# algolia-shopify-sandbox
Sandbox for the widgets provided by the [Algolia app for Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/algolia-search).  
Available here: https://codesandbox.io/s/github/praagyajoshi/algolia-shopify-sandbox/tree/main

- This sandbox is only meant to replicate the Algolia widgets on the search and collection page of a Shopify store and not the whole store itself
- There are 2 pages available for preview: `/search` and `/collections/collection-handle`
- Default configuration has been picked up from the [demo store](https://algolia-app-demo-store.myshopify.com/)
